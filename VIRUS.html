  <h3 id="Virus">COVID-19 PANDEMIC</h3>
  <p>Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by
    a respiratory virus. Nowadays, the rate of transmission
    of the virus has augmented and the OMS declared it a pandemic. Also,
    although COVID-19 affects differently all patients, thereÂ´s
    evidence of specific symptoms presented in most infected patients.
    Some of the most common ones are fever, dry cough,
    tiredness and respiratory difficulties or shortness.
    However, far beyond those visible symptoms, scientists
    discovered that patients with Coronavirus have
    presented neurological symptoms as well. </p>

      <strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong>
      <br>1. People can get infected principally by the respiratory airway.
      <br>2. Most common symptoms start showing up two weeks after getting infected with the virus.
      <br>3. 36.4% of Coronavirus patients presented some neurological diagnoses.
      <br>4. 15% of the people infected manifested deficiency or alterations of consciousness.

      <strong>NERVOUS SYSTEM</strong>
      <br>The hematogenous route, is the principal way of virus invasion of the
      nervous system.
      <br>The virus enters the respiratory system and travels all the way down
      to the lungs. Once there, during gas exchange in the alveoli, the virus gets to the blood.
      <br>Consequently, throughout the blood it crosses the blood brain barrier
      and have direct access to the nervous system.
