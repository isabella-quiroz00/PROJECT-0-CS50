# PROJECT-0-CS50
## NEUROPAGE

Project 0 consists principally of five html files. These contain neuroscience information, along with a variety of scientific articles related to four different emphasis of brainÂ´s function: sleep, eat, think and the effect of viruses in the nervous system. All of these is explained more profoundly in the section of **HOME**.

### Sleep
This section explains briefly the stages of sleep, what regions activate or disactivate in each phase, sleep's function, and how the exam to analyze sleep works. The information in this section is organized in a table.

### Eat
This section provides general information about how food is processed in the body and used by the brain as energy. Also it explains how reward systems activate when eating some specific food, and how its lack of regulation may generate eating disorders.

### Think
The section of Think do not contain explicit information about Memory or Consciousness; but rather provide six scientific articles that the user can check out to get more information.

### Virus
With COVID-19 pandemic attempting the actual world, it was important to include in the page how the virus relate with some of the latest neuroscience investigations. The emphasis of this section is to provide the user general information about Coronavirus and to explain how respiratory viruses can get to the brain and cause neurological symptoms. This section implements Bootstrap properties and commands.

#### Stylesheet
The .css stylesheet is used principally by the section Think. This because each section has a style of its own written within its same html file. Each file contains rather a image, a table, a list (ordered or unordered) or links.
