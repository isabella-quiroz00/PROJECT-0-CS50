    <p>Neuroscience encompasses all the studies and investigations that involve
      the structure of human’s brain and its connection with behaviors or
      complex activities that human beings relate with every day.
      That’s why it’s important not only to get to know brain’s functionality
      and utility, but also, how information travels throughout the nervous
      system and generates, as a result of many huge processes, all the
      different states of mind that humanity knows of. </p>
    <p>This web page will provide you general information about some
      human behaviors such as sleeping, eating and thinking, by explaining
      all the neural processes that take place in the brain. Also, each
      section provides new studies, scientific articles and, in overall,
      new advances in the area of investigation that might be of your interest.
      Finally, due to the actual global crisis with COVID-19 pandemic, you
      can learn about how viruses travel all the way from the lungs into
      the nervous system and generate neurological symptoms in the infected
      patient.</p>
